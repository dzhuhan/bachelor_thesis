Program for handling chess problems. You can open and run it in Qt Creator. Use "edit" mode to add pieces and move them, left mouse button to move a piece and right to delete it. You can also upload a file with position in FEN notation. After choosing problem type, amount of moves and side (program will choose side automatically if you load a file), click the solve button to solve the problem (may take some time).
